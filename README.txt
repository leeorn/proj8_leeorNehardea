cs1c: (.java classes)
    - FHsort: Provided class with several sorting methods

    - TestFile: Test the quicksort method and finding the optimal number of
    recursions to each array size

    - TimeConverter: Provided class using to measure runtime and get time in
    nanoseconds

resources:
    - OverlayGraphAnnotated.pdf: An overlay graph with 20 different array
    sizes showing number of recursions, 2-300, (x-axis), time it took in
    nanoseconds (y-axis), 0.5*10^9 - 3.5*10^9.

    - zoomedOverlayGraphAnnotated.pdf: A zoomed graph focusing around the
    min-point of the arrays. Axises have te same labels and domain and range
    are 2 - 80; 0.5*10^9 - 3*10^9 correspondingly.

    - valueList_firstRun.csv: The values of the first time running the program
     checking all the array sizes and recursions

    - valueList_secondRun.csv: The values of the second time running the
    program checking all the array sizes and recursions

    - valueList_thirdRun.csv: The values of the third time running the program
    checking all the array sizes and recursions

    - valueList_combined_graphs.xlsx: All the data together, taking the
    average of the runtimes and plotting graphs.
    There're 3 tabs. One for all the data;
    second for the 20 graphs;
    third the 2 overlay graphs.

    -annotationToOverlayGraph. docs: Word file describing the graphs and
    interesting points to my opinion.
